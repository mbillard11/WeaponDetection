# Weapon Detection Project

This project employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) created using the Keras framework. The project's objective is to analyze video feeds and accurately identify the presence of firearms within them. By training the CNN on a diverse dataset, the model has acquired the capability to distinguish between gun-related objects and other elements in the video stream. The goal of the project was to enhance security systems by automatically alerting personnel to the presence of firearms in real-time video surveillance.
